# Fake-News-Classifier:

You can download the dataset from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data?select=train.csv

**First of all basically i imported all the required files and packages which i will use in this project like tensorflow,keras,numpy,pandas,sklearn,matplotlib,seaborn,nltk.I imported all this packages to compare that what is best to detect the fake news as my personal opinion i think to detect fake news Bidirectional LSTM(Long short term memory) in case of DL or  Neural Networks will be the best but for text vectorization you have to use word2vec then only it will give best reslut using other vectorization method is causing the problem of overfitting in case of validation loss.While in case of Machine Learning i will go with RandomForest Classifier(Ensemble technique) with Hyperparameter optimization it will be the best and you can use text vectorization like one hot representation or word2vec.
